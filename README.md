# Order Tracking Application - Refactoring
## Capstone Project 2
### HyperionDev - Immersive Full-Stack & Software Engineer Boot Camp

This was a simple order tracking application that would be used by a fictitious order delivery  
company to keep track of and allocate drivers to deliver meals ordered from restaurants.

This purpose of this iteration of the project was to refactor the original code.
